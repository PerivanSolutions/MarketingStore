  As from the very beginning, we've continued to develop the features and
  functionality completely from client feedback and requests. We believe it is
  a work in progress as we know both technology and corporate governance will
  keep evolving. We have made sure it is flexible enough to accommodate future
  developments and differences in how people communicate with their boards. We
  continue to use client feedback to make Virtualboardroom the best it can
  possibly be.

  We're always keen for your input, too
